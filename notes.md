# Assessment: Remove jQuery

---

## Instructions

Use the code here as the starting point for this assessment: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/maze-stealer?path=public/js/app.js.

Make the application work exactly the same but do so without any jQuery. To break this problem into more manageable steps, start by removing jQuery from app.js method-by-method (create, destroy, etc). Once you’re done, remove the jQuery script tag from index.html (line 56).

If done correctly, everything in your application should work exactly as it did in the original application. What I really like about this exercise is that it really makes you think about what's happening in the application and it's really easy to see if you succeeded — the app either works at the end or it doesn't.

SUBMITTING YOUR ASSESSMENT (REQUIRED):

When you're done, email your Glitch link to team@watchandcode.com. To pass the assessment, your code must fulfill all of the stated requirements. If your submission has problems, we will let you know so that you can fix them. You must pass this assessment before continuing on with the next lesson.
